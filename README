This project uses TfidfVectorizer, multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, and GridSearchCV on amino acid sequences to make enzyme vs non-enzyme classifications.

TO SET UP:
        $conda create -n [new_env] --file req.txt

TO RUN:
        $source activate [new_env]
        $python3 retrieve_data.py 

        After retrieve_data.py has finished running, open two terminals. 

        In one terminal:
        $source activate [new_env]
        $ipython

        In another terminal:
        $source activate [new_env]
        $jupyter notebook

        In the pop up window in a browser, click on CSBProject.ipynb, then click on "Run" to run and generate the report.

        There is also a toy program that may be run in analyze_data.py:
        $python3 analyze_data.py
